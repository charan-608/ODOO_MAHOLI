CivicTrack Implementation Analysis 

Based on the provided files and problem statement, I'll analyze your implementation of CivicTrack (Problem Statement 2) from the Odoo x CGC Mohali Hackathon. 

Current Implementation Status 

Your current implementation includes: 

A login/registration system with: 

Email/password authentication 

Social login (Google, Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn) 

Password strength meter 

Form validation 

Remember me functionality 

Basic dashboard structure 

Service worker for offline functionality 

What's Missing for CivicTrack Requirements 

To fully meet the CivicTrack problem statement requirements, you'll need to add: 

Core Features 

Issue Reporting System 

Form for reporting local issues with: 

Title 

Description 

Category selection (Roads, Lighting, Water Supply, etc.) 

Photo upload (up to 5 images) 

Location selection (GPS or manual) 

Location-Based Filtering 

Only show issues within 3-5km radius 

Distance filter options (1km, 3km, 5km) 

Status Tracking 

Status workflow: Reported → In Progress → Resolved 

Change logs with timestamps 

Notifications for status updates 

Map View 

Display issues as pins on a map 

Filter pins by status/category 

Moderation System 

Flagging system for spam/irrelevant reports 

Admin review for flagged content 

User banning capability 

Admin Dashboard 

Issue management 

Analytics (total issues, most reported categories) 

User management 

Recommended Implementation Approach 

Database Schema Additions 

javascript 

// Example structure to add to localStorage 

const issues = [{ 

  id: 'uuid', 

  title: 'Pothole on Main Street', 

  description: 'Large pothole causing traffic issues', 

  category: 'Roads', 

  status: 'Reported', // or 'In Progress', 'Resolved' 

  location: { lat: 30.123, lng: 76.456 }, 

  reporterId: 'user-id', 

  photos: ['base64-img1', 'base64-img2'], 

  createdAt: 'ISO-date', 

  updates: [ 

    { status: 'Reported', timestamp: 'ISO-date', userId: 'user-id' }, 

    { status: 'In Progress', timestamp: 'ISO-date', userId: 'admin-id' } 

  ], 

  flags: [{ userId: 'user-id', reason: 'spam' }] 

}]; 

New Pages to Create 

report-issue.html - Form for submitting new issues 

issue-detail.html - View for individual issue with status updates 

map-view.html - Map showing nearby issues 

admin.html - Admin dashboard (partially implemented) 

Geolocation Integration 

javascript 

// Get user location 

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => { 

  const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords; 

  // Store or use location 

}); 

Distance Calculation 

javascript 

function calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) { 

  // Haversine formula implementation 

  // Returns distance in km 

} 

Suggested Improvements 

Enhance the Current Code 

Add proper error handling for geolocation 

Implement photo compression for uploads 

Add loading states for async operations 

Security 

Implement rate limiting for issue submissions 

Add CAPTCHA for anonymous reports 

Performance 

Implement pagination for issue lists 

Add lazy loading for images 

Accessibility 

Ensure all forms have proper labels 

Add ARIA attributes for screen readers 

Next Steps 

Implement the issue reporting form with all required fields 

Create the map view using Leaflet or Google Maps API 

Build the admin dashboard with moderation tools 

Implement notifications for status changes 

Add filtering functionality for issues
